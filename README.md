## COS424 assignment 2, spring 2019
### Nicholas Kim and Nicholas Schmeller

to be written, if we put anything in here. maybe we can go public with our results as well once we finish, because fragile families is a pretty public thing

### a note on large files:
We used Git Large File Storage to share large files. This means we have a local .gitattributes file to track which files are associated with LFS. Collaborators on this repo must have LFS installed on their machines to receive actual file objects instead of pointer files on a clone. Follow these links:

2. https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-git-large-file-storage

The large files take up about 650 MB of disk space. 

Or, the large files can be accessed via OPR or a cloud storage for team members. @nick basically it doesn't matter if you have git LFS or not because if you locally copy the files to the repo then the pointers should line up but it might be useful to know how to do this in the future.
