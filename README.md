### Nicholas Kim and Nicholas Schmeller

to be written, if we put anything in here. maybe we can go public with our results as well once we finish, because fragile families is a pretty public thing

### a note on large files:
We used Git Large File Storage to share large files. This means we have a local .gitattributes file to track which files are associated with LFS. Collaborators on this repo must have LFS installed on their machines to receive actual file objects instead of pointer files on a clone. Follow these links:

The large files take up about 650 MB of disk space.
